Junior Frontend Code Challenge

1) The framework used  to develop the solution to the code challenge is React.js.
2) The folder 'node_modules' should be installed inside the 'code_challenge' folder.
3) The information for the packages which need to be installed are described in package.json and package-lock.json.
4) The main .js files for the application are in /src/components folder and the .scss, .css in /public/media folder 
   and are connected to the styles.scss file.

   the API is called (after 400ms typing pause), the popup opens and the results are shown. 
   If there are no search results (invalid characters or no data) a message is shown.

   If there is no input text, or no results are returned from the service the button is disabled.
